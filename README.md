### Project description : 
The goal of this project is create a classifier that predicts how the level of some text in French (A1,..., C2)

### Approach :
We, first, did the imposed model : logistic regression, KNN, decision tree and random forest. Then, we tried to find hyperparameters in order to improve our models and we also did an another simple model : SVC. After that, we combined our two best model to try to improve our results. Finally, we tested an another technique to improve, it was the text embedding.

### Summary of the results table :
